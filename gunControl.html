                            <p>Everytown is a movement of Americans working together to end gun violence and build safer
                                communities. Gun violence touches every town in America. For too long, change has been
                                thwarted by the Washington gun lobby and by leaders who refuse to take common-sense
                                steps that will save lives.

                                But something is changing. Nearly 6 million mayors, moms, cops, teachers, survivors, gun
                                owners, students and everyday Americans have come together to make their own communities
                                safer. Together, we are fighting for the changes that we know will save lives.

                            <p>
                                Founded in 2014 by Margaret Bazckowski, Strides for Peace is a registered 501(c)(3)
                                which envisions a Chicago where all can thrive and live free of the fear of gun
                                violence.

                                Our mission is to increase the collective impact of community organizations working to
                                end gun violence, save lives and build a stronger Chicago.

                                Our Community Partners and Affiliates are cornerstones of their communities and share
                                the common goal of ending gun violence. By creating turn-key opportunities that generate
                                unencumbered financial resources, Strides for Peace supports existing programs while
                                building an infrastructure for new collaboration and capacity building.

                                We are on a mission and need your help. We hope you’ll join us, because every stride
                                counts.

                                <p>
                                    Cure Violence is a teaching, training, research and assessment NGO focused on a health
                                    approach to violence prevention. The Cure Violence health model is used by more than 50
                                    communities in the U.S., as well as countries ranging from El Salvador to South Africa to
                                    Syria. Cities and organizations implementing the Cure Violence health model regularly
                                    experience reductions in violence within the first year ranging from 40-70% and greater
                                    reductions in subsequent years. We provide cities and organizations with the training and
                                    technical assistance to effectively implement the Cure Violence model. We are currently
                                    focusing our efforts on three parts of the world: the United States, Latin America, and the
                                    Middle East/North Africa.
        
                                    Cure Violence is also leading a movement to treat violence as a health problem. We intend to
                                    fundamentally change the discourse on and approach to violence from the prevailing paradigm
                                    that understands violence as moral corruption or human failing that applies punitive
                                    strategies to address the issue, to one that includes an understanding and addressing of
                                    violence as a health problem – a contagious epidemic. To do so successfully, we are
                                    activating voices and resources throughout our comprehensive health system and establishing
                                    violence prevention as a health sector responsibility and imperative.
