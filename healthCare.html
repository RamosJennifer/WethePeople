                            <p> Since 1921, Community Nurse Health Center has served as a community healthcare center
                                for residents of the western suburbs of Chicago, focusing on those who have limited
                                access to care. They value patient dignity, community collaboration and prevention and
                                wellness by delivering coordinated and integrated health care services and education

                                To meet this mission, Community Nurse serves over 4400 low income children and adults,
                                including those experiencing homelessness or unstable housing, by providing direct
                                medical and dental care and health education such as medical preventive services,
                                chronic disease management, prenatal and obstetrical care, and oral health treatments.
                                Patient care includes a strong local network for specialty care, and the integration of
                                behavioral health services with on-site psychiatry and counseling services.

                                Community Nurse's vision is a healthy and productive community where all residents have
                                access to quality healthcare
