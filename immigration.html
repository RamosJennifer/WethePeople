                            groups, faiths, and backgrounds. Our primary focus is to assist these resilient individuals
                            in becoming an independent, self-supporting member of their new community.
                            ​As the largest resettlement agency in Illinois, RefugeeOne has welcomed more than 18,000
                            refugees since 1982. RefugeeOne walks alongside refugees from the moment they land at O'Hare
                            International Airport—welcoming them to Chicago and providing furnished apartments, English
                            classes, job search support, mental health care, youth programming, and mentors to help them
                            adjust to life in the U.S.

                        <p>
                            CAIR-Chicago is a 501(c)3 not-for-profit Muslim civil rights organization registered
                            independently in Illinois. CAIR is the nation’s largest Muslim civil rights and advocacy
                            group. Though it leverages the resources, expertise, and knowledge base of CAIR (based in
                            Washington), CAIR-Chicago functions as an independent organization that sets its own
                            strategy and goals. We work to attain equal opportunity for - and normalize the image of -
                            Muslims in America. With a mission to defend civil rights, fight bigotry, and promote
                            tolerance, our Civil Rights Department provides pro bono legal services to Muslims who have
                            faced discrimination as a result of their race, religion or ethnicity. Our primary mandate
                            is to promote and defend the constitutional rights of all Americans and to assist those who
                            cannot attain justice themselves.

                                GirlForward works with girls ages 14-21 in grades 9-12 who identify as refugees,
                                immigrants, and asylum seekers. We support girls through three core programs.

                                Our Mentoring Program pairs girls with mentors to engage in "4W" activities (Wellness,
                                Wisdom, Wallet and World) in order to explore their passions and graduate from high
                                school. Girls are paired with women mentors within in the local community for at least
                                one school year, and they meet together at least two hours weekly to talk about anything
                                from school, to relationships, to careers. Mentors and mentees are friends, role models,
                                teachers, and confidants for each other.
